IS117 Assignment 3

1. Install Git and WebStorm
First, make sure you have Git and WebStorm installed on your computer. You can download Git from the official website  Git official website: https://git-scm.com/, and WebStorm from the JetBrains website WebStorm download page: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/ .

2. Create a Github account
If you don't already have one, create a Github account at the website: https://github.com/. Github is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.

3. Create a new repository on Github
Once you have a Github account, you can create a new repository by clicking on the "New" button on the repository page. Give your repository a name and a description, and select "Public" or "Private" as desired.

4. Clone the repository in WebStorm
To clone the repository in WebStorm, open the IDE and select "Check out from Version Control" from the welcome screen or the "VCS" menu. Choose "Git" as the version control system, and enter the URL of the repository you just created on Github. Choose a local path to save the repository to, and click "Clone".

5. Create a new branch
It's generally a good practice to work on a new branch rather than the main branch, so that you can easily switch back to a working version of the code if needed. To create a new branch, click on the "Git" menu in WebStorm and select "Branches". Click the "+" button to create a new branch, and give it a descriptive name.

6. Make changes to the code
Now that you have a branch to work on, make any changes you need to the code. When you're ready to save your changes, go to the "Commit Changes" dialog in WebStorm. Enter a commit message describing the changes you made, and click "Commit".

7. Push changes to Github
To push your changes to Github, click on the "Git" menu in WebStorm and select "Push". This will upload your changes to the branch you created on Github.

8. Create a pull request
If you're working on a project with multiple contributors, it's important to create a pull request so that other contributors can review your changes before they're merged into the main branch. To create a pull request, go to the repository page on Github and click the "New pull request" button. Select the branch with your changes, and the branch you want to merge your changes into. Give your pull request a descriptive title and description, and click "Create pull request".

9. Merge changes into the main branch
Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, you can merge your changes into the main branch. Go to the pull request page on Github and click the "Merge" button. Enter a commit message describing the changes, and click "Confirm merge".
